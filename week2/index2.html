        .Functions
        -A function is a chunk of code that can be referenced by a name, and is almost like
        a small, self-contained mini program. Functions can help reduce repetition and
        make code easier to follow.
        .Callbacks
        -A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback
        <br> Recursion is a programming concept applied when a function calls itself several times. A function will have a definite break condition that indicates when it should stop calling itself. Recursion employs the concept of looping. A loop occurs when a number iterates several 
        times until a specified condition is met. <a href="https://www.section.io/engineering-education/an-introduction-to-memoization-in-javascript/">JavaScript Momorization</a>

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <!-- function sing(song) {
              console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}`);
          }
          function dance() {
              console.log("I'm moving my body to the groove.");
          } -->
         <!-- 1. sing('Let It Go', dance) This method this not work for me -->
          <!-- 2. sing('Let It Go', dance()); This method works but print the dance function -->
          <!-- before the sing function -->
          1. Why is it that when I called the dance function without the brackets
          it did not work? <br>

          2. Does node.js interfere with javascript functionality when installed
          on the same machine? <br>
          3. With my html file how do I create the second link without having the same
          element stored in the week1 link?
          <!-- my html -->
              <!-- <ol></ol>
             <ol id="w2"></ol> -->
             <!-- my javascript -->
             <!-- const select2 = document.querySelector("#w2");
            const links2 = [
              "1_Week02"
            ]
            console.log(links2);

            const markup2 = links2.map(item => `<li><a href="week2/index2.html">${item}</a></li>`).join(' ')
            select2.innerHTML = markup2 -->
