        Object: The object-based paradigm is one of the design patterns used in JavaScript. 
        An object can be referred to as a collection of properties. 
        A property on the other hand is an association of a key(name) and a value.

        The Document Object Model (DOM)
         is a tree-like structure showing a hierarchical relationship 
         between different HTML elements. The DOM can be referred to as 
         a programming API for HTML and XML documents according to w3.org. 
         It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document
        is accessed and manipulated. <a href="https://www.section.io/engineering-education/dom-manipulation-with-javascript/">More on DOM</a>

        <br> EVENTS : Events in JavaScript make browsing very comfortable,
         besides their usefulness to programmers. Every programmer must have
          a clear understanding of JavaScript events for more intuitive browsing.
