        <h1>Validating forms</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>When you go to any popular site with a registration form, and you will notice that 
        they provide feedback when you don't enter your data in the format 
        they are expecting. You'll get messages such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"This field is required" (You can't leave this field blank).</li>
            <li>"Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx" (A specific 
                data format is required for it to be considered valid).</li>
            <li>"Please enter a valid email address" (the data you entered is not in the right format).</li>
            <li>"Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and contain one uppercase letter, one symbol, and a number." 
                (A very specific data format is required for your data)</li>
            <li>"Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and contain one uppercase letter, one symbol, and a number."
                 (A very specific data format is required for your data).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is called form validation. When you enter data, the browser and/or the web
             server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the
              constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called 
              client-side validation, while validation done on the server is 
            called server-side validation. In this chapter we are focusing on client-side validation.</p>
        <h2>Different types of client-side validation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features,
                 which we've discussed in many places throughout this module. 
                 This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. 
                 Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript,
                  but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.
            </li>
            <li>JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. 
                This validation is completely customizable, 
                but you need to create it all (or use a library).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Validating against a regular expression</h3>
        <p>Another useful validation feature is the pattern attribute, 
            which expects a Regular Expression as its value. A regular
             expression (regex) is a pattern that can be used to match 
             character combinations in text strings, so regexps are ideal
              for form validation and serve a variety of other uses in JavaScript.</p>
              <p>Below are some examples to give you a basic idea of how they work.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>ab?c—Matches a, optionally followed by a single b, followed by c. ( ac or abc)</li>
                  <li>a — Matches one character that is a (not b, not aa, and so on).</li>
                  <li>abc|xyz — Matches exactly abc or exactly xyz (but not abcxyz or a or y, and so on)</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>HTML step Attribute</h3>
            <p>
                The step attribute specifies the interval between legal numbers in an input element.  <br>
                Example: if step="3", legal numbers could be -3, 0, 3, 6, etc.  <br>
                Tip: The step attribute can be used together with the max and min attributes to create a range of legal values.
            </p>
            <h3>The Constraint Validation API</h3>
            <p>the Constraint Validation API, which consists of a set of methods and properties
                 available on the following form element DOM interfaces:</p><br>

                 <p>
                    HTMLButtonElement represents a button element <br>
                        HTMLFieldSetElement represents a fieldset element <br>
                        HTMLInputElement (represents an input element)  <br>
                        HTMLOutputElement (represents an output element)  <br>
                        HTMLSelectElement (represents a select element)  <br>
                        HTMLTextAreaElement (represents a textarea element)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    The Constraint Validation API also makes the following 
                    methods available on the above elements and the form element.
                 </p> <br>
                 checkValidity(): Returns true if the element's value has no
                  validity problems; false otherwise. If the element is invalid, 
                  this method also fires an invalid event on the element. <br>
                reportValidity(): Reports invalid field(s) using events.
                Useful in combination with preventDefault() 
                in an onSubmit event handler <br>
                setCustomValidity(message): Adds a custom error message to the element; 
                if you set a custom error message, the element is considered to be invalid, 
                and the specified error is displayed. This lets you use JavaScript code to establish
                a validation failure other than those offered by the standard HTML5 validation constraints.
                The message is shown to the user when reporting the problem. <br>
                <h1>Using the Fetch API</h1>
                 <h4>Definition</h4>
                 <p>
                    The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and 
                    manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. 
                    It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, 
                    logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network. <br>
                    The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request to the server and 
                    load the information in the webpages. The request can be of any APIs
                     that returns the data of the format JSON or XML. 
                    This method returns a promise. <br>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Syntax: <br>
                    fetch( url, options )  <br>
                    Parameters: This method accept two parameters as mentioned above and described below: <br>

                    URL: It is the URL to which the request is to be made.  <br>
                    Options: It is an array of properties. It is an optional parameter.  <br>
                    Return Value: It returns a promises whether it is resolved or not. The return data can be of the format JSON or XML.  <br>
                    It can be the array of objects or simply a single object.  <br>
                 </p>
                 <h3>JavaScript Async</h3>
                  "async and await make promises easier to write"  <br>
                  async makes a function return a Promise  <br>
                  await makes a function wait for a Promise <br>
