    <h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>
    <h2>Errors,Exceptions, and Warnings</h2>
    <h2>Errors</h2>
    <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program.
        Erros are caused by: <br>
        System error: There is a problem with the system or external devices with
        which the program is interacting. <br>
        Programmer error: The program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it
        could even be as simple as a typo. <br>
        User error: The user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is
        unable to handle. <br>
        <h2><strong>Exceptions</strong></h2>
        <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the
            program to deal with the error. For example, trying to call a method that is
            354 JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition
            nonexistent will result in a reference error that raises an exception
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Warnings</strong></h2>
        <p>A warning can occur if there is an error in the code that is not enough to cause the
            program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning.
        </p>
        <h2>Debugging</h2>
        <p> Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then
            dealing with them. In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not
            always where it originated, so you will need to run through the program to see
            what is happening at different stages of its execution. When doing this, it can be
            useful to create what are known as breakpoints, which halt the progress of the
            code and allow us to view the value of different variables at that point in the
            program</p>
            <h2>Alert</h2>
            <p>alert() stops a program from running until
                OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put 
                breakpoints in the code that let us
                check the value of variables at that point to
                 see if they are what we expect them to
                be.</p> <br>
                <h3>Note:</h3>
                <p>Using alerts for debugging was the only option in the past, but JavaScript
                    development has progressed since then and their use is discouraged for
                    debugging purposes today
